# After we flashed uBoot, uImage and uInitrd to the device memery, 
# we can not partition HDD drives and copy the rootfs to the root partition
# We do rootfs with last stable version of Debian by:
sudo debootstrap --arch armhf stable rootfs/ http://deb.debian.org/debian

#The result will be in rootfs foolder. 

# In order to make this rootfs able to boot we need to setup hostname, network (DHCP) and fstab.
