# After we flashed uBoot, uImage and uInitrd to the device memory, 
# we can not partition HDD drives and copy the rootfs to the root partition
# We do rootfs with last stable version of Debian by:
sudo multistrap -a armhf -d rootfs -f rootfs.conf
cd rootfs/
tar -cvf rootfs.tar.gz *

# Move files to the device





# In order to make this rootfs able to boot we need to setup hostname, network (DHCP) and fstab.
